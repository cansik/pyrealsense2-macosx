[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyrealsense2-macosx)](https://pypi.org/project/pyrealsense2-macosx/)

Prebuilt pyrealsense2 packages of the [librealsense](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) library for macOS as an addition to the [PyPI prebuilt](https://pypi.org/project/pyrealsense2/) packages by Intel.

### Prebuilt
To install the prebuilt wheel packages from this repository, run the following command (macOSX librealsense is included):

```bash
pip install pyrealsense2-macosx
```

*Supported Platforms & Versions*

- OS: *macOS Catalina*[*](#older-macos-and-python-) (`10.15`), *macOS Big Sur*[*](#older-macos-and-python-) (`11`), macOS Monterey (`12`) and higher
- Architecture: `Intel (x86_64)`, `Apple Silicon (arm64)`
- Python: `3.6`\*, `3.7`\*, `3.8`, `3.9`, `3.10`, `3.11`, `3.12`

#### requirements.txt

To use `pyrealsense2` in a `requirements.txt` in combination with `pyrealsense2-macosx` use the following lines. This will install either the official Windows / Linux version or the MacOSX pre-built wheel package.

```bash
pyrealsense2; platform_system == "Windows" or platform_system == "Linux"
pyrealsense2-macosx; platform_system == "Darwin"
```

#### Older MacOS and Python (*)

With the new build pipeline supporting MacOS 12, the binary packages generated by this are universal targeted for `x86_64` and `amd64`. To allow this, we set the `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to `12`. 

- For Catalina (`10.5`) use the older releases like [2.49.0](https://pypi.org/project/pyrealsense2-macosx/2.49.0/)
- For BigSur (`11.0`) use the older releases like [2.53.1](https://pypi.org/project/pyrealsense2-macosx/2.53.1/)

```bash
# Catalina
pip install pyrealsense2-macosx~=2.49.0

# BigSur
pip install pyrealsense2-macosx~=2.53.1
```

#### Sudo

Since `2.50.0` the realsense binaries have to run under sudo on some MacOS to find a device. Otherwise strange errors appear (`failed to set power state`). This seems to be a bug in the realsense framework and is already discussed in [this librealsense2 issue](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/9916#issuecomment-1082893427).


### Manual Build

#### Prerequisites
Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and the following packages:

```bash
sudo xcode-select --install
brew install cmake pkg-config openssl
brew install --cask powershell

# the vulkan sdk seems to not be needed anymore
# and is deprecated anyways (download error 404)
# brew install apenngrace/vulkan/vulkan-sdk --cask
```

And set up a new python virtual environment:

```bash
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Build

Run the build script in your preferred shell.

```bash
pwsh librealsense-python-mac.ps1
```

It is possible to set the [tag version](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tags) to build older releases:

```
pwsh librealsense-python-mac.ps1 -tag v2.49.0
```

The prebuild wheel files are copied into the `./dist` directory. By default, the dylib is added to the wheel file with the delocate toolkit. It is possible to disable this behaviour for just the python build:

```
pwsh librealsense-python-mac.ps1 -delocate $false
```

#### Multi-Architecture Packages
The buildscript creates binaries which are targeted to `arm64` and `x86_64`. At the moment I could not find a way to tell the wheel package to set a *universal* tag. For now it is just possible to rename the wheel and change the architecture to the other platform and the packge will work there too.

#### Installation

To install the wheel package just use the default pip install command.

```bash
pip install pyrealsense2-2.48.0-cp39-cp39-macosx_11_0_x86_64.whl
```
